Every PR that introduces a user-visible change adds a line to `[Unreleased]` in the same
PR. A release PR moves the `[Unreleased]` entries into a new per-version file under
`docs/changelog/v<MAJOR>/v<X.Y.Z>.md` and adds an index row below.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `workerpool.Pool` — bounded-queue worker pool (roadmap 2.1): blocking or fail-fast
  `Submit`, context-aware `Stop` with full drain, opt-in panic containment (ADR-0005).
- `pubsub.Broker[T]` — filtered in-memory publish-subscribe broker (roadmap 2.2):
  at-most-once buffered delivery with observable drops, no broker goroutines, additive
  `Close` (ADR-0006).
- `fanin.Merge[T]` — multi-channel merge with completeness and per-input ordering
  guarantees, cancel-or-drain consumer contract (roadmap 2.3, ADR-0007).
