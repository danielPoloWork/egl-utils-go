# 2026-07-15 — Milestone 6.2: logger.Context — Milestone 6 complete

## What got done

- **Roadmap 6.2 `logger.WithFields` / `logger.FromContext`** (branch `feat/logger-context`,
  ADR-0020): the context-propagation half of the logging surface — **Milestone 6 is complete**.
  Spec §5 froze `WithFields(ctx, ...Field) context.Context` and `FromContext(ctx) *slog.Logger`.
- **`Field` is a type alias for `slog.Attr`** (`type Field = slog.Attr`), so slog values are Fields
  and vice versa — no parallel type system. Thin constructors `String`/`Int`/`Bool`/`Duration`/`Any`
  wrap the slog equivalents so callers need not import slog for common cases.
- **Fields accumulate copy-on-write.** `WithFields` copies the context's existing field slice,
  appends the new ones, and stores under an **unexported context key** (ADR-0013 idiom). An outer
  scope's fields survive into inner scopes; the parent's slice is never mutated, so sibling chains
  stay independent. Zero fields → context returned unchanged.
- **`FromContext` derives from `slog.Default`** (ADR-0016 precedent), enriched via `Logger.With`;
  with no fields it returns `slog.Default()` untouched. Wiring:
  `slog.SetDefault(logger.NewStructured(...))` (6.1) once, and every `FromContext` yields a
  structured, context-enriched logger — closing the logging story.
- Local gauntlet green (portable Go 1.26.5): build, vet, full `go test ./...`, **100% logger
  coverage**, gofumpt clean, golangci-lint v2 0 issues (fixed a revive doc-comment form on `String`),
  govulncheck clean, `consistency_lint.py` OK. Verified empirically that slog's JSONHandler encodes a
  `Duration` attr as nanoseconds (float in JSON), not `"2s"` — adjusted the test. `-race` is CI-only
  locally (no cgo compiler).

## Where the project stands

M1–M5 complete and merged; **M6 complete** in code — 6.1 logger.Structured (#23) merged, 6.2
logger.Context drafted on `feat/logger-context`, awaiting the maintainer to open and merge. README
milestone table: M6 → ✅ done. **Five completed milestones now sit unreleased** — M2 (v0.2.0) …
M6 (v0.6.0); the maintainer has been deferring the release cut deliberately in favor of forward
progress. That backlog is now substantial.

## How the next session resumes

Wait for the 6.2 PR to merge, closing Milestone 6. Then **Milestone 7 — Caching & data helpers**:
7.1 `cache.InMemory` (generic TTL cache with a periodic cleanup goroutine — leak- and race-sensitive,
goleak-gated, rides the concurrency tier Fable 5 · high) and 7.2 `db.Transaction` (auto-rollback on
error/panic, Opus 4.8 · high). M7 returns to concurrency-critical territory after the thin M5/M6
wrappers. **Strongly reconsider cutting the release backlog first** (five milestones). Portable Go
toolchain under `%TEMP%\go-portable`; `/v2` golangci-lint path; `-race` CI-only locally.
